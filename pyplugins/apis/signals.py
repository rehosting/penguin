Signals Plugin (signals.py) for Penguin
=======================================

This module provides the Signals plugin for the Penguin framework, enabling the triggering of core dumps, crash snapshots, and custom signals in the guest OS via the hypervisor portal. It is useful for debugging, analysis, and automation of guest process state.

Features
--------

- Trigger a full snapshot and core dump in the guest.
- Send SIGABRT or custom signals to the current process in the guest.
- Coroutine-based API for integration with other Penguin plugins.

Example Usage
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from penguin import plugins

    # Trigger a full snapshot and core dump
    pid = yield from plugins.signals.crash_snapshot()

    # Send SIGABRT to the current process
    pid = yield from plugins.signals.self_abort()

    # Send a custom signal (e.g., SIGTERM)
    pid = yield from plugins.signals.self_signal(15)
