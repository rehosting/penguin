Penguin APIs Package
====================

This package contains core API plugins for the Penguin framework, providing interfaces for interacting with guest memory, user-space probes, and other hypervisor-level features.

Overview
--------

- **mem.py**: Safe and efficient guest memory access and manipulation.
- **uprobes.py**: User-space probe (uprobe) registration and event handling.
- *(Other API modules may be present for additional functionality.)*

These APIs are designed to be used as plugins, enabling advanced instrumentation, tracing, and analysis of guest systems in a modular and extensible way.
