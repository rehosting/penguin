"""
Older required plugins can be added here to maintain compatibility with
previous configurations. These plugins are not intended to be used in
current versions of Penguin, but rather to ensure that older configurations
can still function without errors.

This module is primarily for backward compatibility and should not be used
in new configurations. If you are creating a new plugin, please refer to the
current plugin architecture and guidelines.
