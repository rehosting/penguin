hyper Plugin Package
====================

The ``hyper`` package provides a collection of plugins for the Penguin hypervisor environment. These plugins enable advanced monitoring, instrumentation, and communication between the guest system and the hypervisor, supporting a variety of use cases such as coverage analysis, environment variable tracking, command logging, and inter-plugin messaging.

Overview
--------

**Purpose:**  
The ``hyper`` package is designed to extend the capabilities of the Penguin hypervisor by offering modular plugins that respond to guest hypercalls, manage shared memory regions, and facilitate plugin-to-plugin communication.

**Key Features:**
- Logging and auditing of shell and Bash command execution.
- Tracking and manipulation of U-Boot environment variables.
- Canary value monitoring for integrity checks.
- Portal mechanism for efficient command and data transfer between plugins and the hypervisor.
- Utilities for handling hypercall constants and plugin configuration.

**Typical Usage:**  
Plugins in this package are loaded by the Penguin framework and operate transparently, responding to specific events or hypercalls from the guest. Output is typically written to files in a specified output directory for later analysis.

Included Plugins
----------------

- ``bash_command``: Logs Bash command executions.
- ``canary``: Monitors canary values for security/integrity.
- ``consts``: Provides access to hypercall and portal constants.
- ``portal``: Implements the portal communication mechanism.
- ``shell``: Tracks shell script coverage and environment usage.
