Penguin Interventions Plugins
=============================

This package contains a collection of **Penguin interventions** plugins for dynamic analysis, emulation, and modeling of embedded Linux systems. These plugins provide mechanisms to intercept, log, and model various guest OS behaviors, such as pseudo-file accesses, NVRAM operations, symbolic execution of IOCTLs, and more.

Overview
--------

**Purpose:**  
Enhance the observability, control, and modeling of guest system interactions during emulation or analysis.  
Useful for firmware analysis, device modeling, and dynamic introspection.

**Key Plugins:**
- ``pseudofiles``: Model and log accesses to pseudo-files (e.g., ``/dev``, ``/proc``, ``/sys``).
- ``nvram2``: Track and log NVRAM get/set/clear operations.
- ``hyperfile``: Provide a hypercall-based interface for guest/host file operations.
- ``symex``: Symbolically execute IOCTLs to discover distinct execution paths and constraints.

**Usage:**  
Plugins are loaded via the Penguin framework and can be configured for specific analysis tasks.
