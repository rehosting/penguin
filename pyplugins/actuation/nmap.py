"""
Nmap Plugin (nmap.py) for Penguin
=================================

This module provides the Nmap plugin, which automatically performs service and vulnerability scans
on guest services exposed to the host via the VPN plugin. It listens for 'on_bind' events published
by the VPN plugin and launches nmap scans against the corresponding host ports.

Features
--------

- Subscribes to VPN 'on_bind' events to detect new guest services exposed to the host.
- Launches nmap scans (in a separate thread) for each new TCP service, storing results as XML files in the output directory.
- Supports custom nmap configurations if present.
- Manages and cleans up subprocesses for running nmap scans.

Arguments
---------

- None

Plugin Interface
----------------

- Subscribes to the VPN plugin's 'on_bind' event to trigger scans.
- Does not provide a direct interface for other plugins, but writes scan results to files in the output directory.

Overall Purpose
---------------

The Nmap plugin automates the discovery and analysis of guest services exposed to the host, aiding
in security assessment and service enumeration during emulation.
