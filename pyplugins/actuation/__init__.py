# Actuation Plugins for Penguin

The `actuation` package contains plugins that automate actions and service interactions
within the Penguin emulation environment. These plugins can perform tasks such as
network scanning, web content fetching, and VPN bridging, enabling automated analysis and
testing of guest services exposed to the host.


Each plugin is designed to be used within the Penguin plugin system and may subscribe to or publish events for automation workflows.
