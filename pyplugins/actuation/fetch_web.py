FetchWeb Plugin (fetch_web.py) for Penguin
==========================================

This module provides the FetchWeb plugin, which automatically fetches web pages from guest services
exposed to the host (typically on ports 80 and 443) via the VPN plugin. It listens for 'on_bind' events
published by the VPN plugin and attempts to retrieve web content from the corresponding host ports.
The plugin is responsible for:

- Subscribing to VPN 'on_bind' events to detect new web services exposed to the host.
- Enqueuing fetch tasks for HTTP/HTTPS ports (80, 443) and processing them in a worker thread.
- Fetching web content using wget and logging the response size and entropy.
- Optionally shutting down the emulation after a successful fetch or after failure, based on arguments.

Arguments
---------

- outdir (str): Output directory for storing fetched web content.
- shutdown_after_www (bool, optional): If True, shut down emulation after a successful fetch.
- shutdown_on_failure (bool, optional): If True, shut down emulation if no responsive servers are found.

Plugin Interface
----------------

- Subscribes to the VPN plugin's 'on_bind' event to trigger web fetches.
- Does not provide a direct interface for other plugins, but writes fetched content to files in the output directory.

Overall Purpose
---------------

The FetchWeb plugin automates the retrieval and analysis of web content from guest services exposed to the host,
aiding in service validation and content inspection during emulation.
