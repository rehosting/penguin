"""
Events Base Models
==================

This module defines the SQLAlchemy base classes and the core `Event` model for the penguin event database.
All event types inherit from `Event`, which provides polymorphic mapping for different event subtypes.

Example usage
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    from events.base import Event, Base

Classes
-------

- Base: Declarative base for all ORM models.
- Event: Base class for all event records, supporting polymorphic identity.

Table Structure
---------------

The `event` table contains:
- id: Primary key for the event.
- type: Polymorphic type identifier.
- procname: Name of the process involved in the event.
- proc_id: Process ID.

    Attributes
    ----------
    id : int
        Primary key for the event.
    type : str
        Polymorphic type identifier for the event.
    procname : str
        Name of the process involved in the event.
    proc_id : int
        Process ID associated with the event.

    SQLAlchemy polymorphic mapping is used to allow subclasses to represent different event types.
